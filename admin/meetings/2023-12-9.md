- Eric
- Shrivaths
- Sidd

## Agenda
- Paging check in
- Settings check in
- ADR check in
- Code of conduct

## Minutes

### Paging check in
- Om has paging working, capped to 250 posts
- Jackson thinks that's ok for now

### Settings check in
- 100% unit test coverage, functions to add remove and reset to default
- Caveat: not connected to the markup yet
- Merged main into settings
- Want to make a custom element for settings entry
- Om: custom element code is hard to unit test
- Jackson: we can settle for less than 100% coverage if something is hard to unit test -- we'll need other kinds of tests anyway

### ADR check in
- No ADRs from present members

### Eric check in
- Working with Birdy on unit test
- Writing some test cases here and there, "ad hoc"
- "Struggling to make adequate contribution" given unfamiliarity
- Asked about ADR completeness

### Code of Conduct
- Jackson: not much progress, hard to think of meaningful things to put on here
- Busy working on settings.js and unit tests

Shrivaths and Sidd arrive

### Shrivaths check in
- Nothing new w.r.t. JavaScript

Om: PR for paging is ready to be merged
Linked to issue

### Sidd check in
- Completed rough draft for ADRs **(need to be reviewed by authors)**
- Working on general README (adding to Josh's work)
  - adding architecture and repo structure

Sprint was supposed to go to today, but we're behind (and also have more time than we thought we did, but let's not rely on that)

## Follow up tomorrow via Slack:
- Improved algorithm (Lakshya?) Some of the JS team
- Stiching settings and JS together / making settings.html dynamic -- Jackson, Om, whoever else is available tonight
  - Should get more attention than algo right now because it's core functionality
- Check ADRs that you recall anything about
- Code of Conduct yet again

Slack ping will be in the morning, respond ASAP even if you haven't looked into anything yet

- PR time
- Shrivaths is a maybe for tonight's jam, depending on studying
- Om and Jackson will be on that grind
*Meeting ended at 3:37pm*
