# Meeting Information

There are 3 meetings each week, each being 30 minutes long. Since there is no single time when all team members are available, team members are encouraged to attend at least 2 meetings each week, and read meeting notes for any meeting that they miss.

## Meeting Times
- Monday 4:30 pm
- Wednesday 4:30 pm
- Saturday 3:00 pm

Additional meetings for subteams or the whole team might be scheduled as needed.
