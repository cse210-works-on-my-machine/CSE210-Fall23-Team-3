# Title: Adoption of Node.js Native Testing for the Project

## Decision Description
Team decided to adopt Node.js native testing tools, for implementing our unit tests. This decision is based on the need to ensure that our JavaScript code is reliable and maintainable, while also considering the simplicity and ease of use that comes with using a native module.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Mocha/Chai**: A popular testing framework with a rich set of features and plugins.
- **Jest**: A comprehensive testing solution developed by Facebook, which includes test running and assertions.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| No additional dependencies required, reducing complexity | Limited functionality compared to full-fledged testing frameworks |
| Consistent with Node.js environment, no context switching | Might require additional libraries for more advanced testing needs |
| Fast execution due to native support | Less community support and fewer examples compared to popular frameworks like Jest or Mocha |
