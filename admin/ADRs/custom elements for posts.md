# Title: Use of Custom Elements for Posts

## Decision Description
Decided to implement custom elements for posts within our web application. Custom elements will allow us to encapsulate and reuse HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for post components, ensuring a more maintainable codebase.

## Alternatives Considered
- Standard HTML elements with class-based styling
    - This approach is straightforward but can lead to repetitive code and harder maintenance.
- Framework-specific components (e.g., React components, Vue components)
    - Tightly couples our post components to a specific framework.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Encapsulates functionality and styling, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code | Requires understanding of Web Components, which might have a learning curve for some team members |
| Promotes reusability across different parts of the application or even across different projects | Browser support for custom elements is good but may require polyfills for older browsers |
| Keeps the application framework-agnostic, allowing for easier transitions between frameworks if needed | Potentially more complex setup compared to using framework-specific components |
