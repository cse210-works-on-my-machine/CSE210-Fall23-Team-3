# Title: Adoption of ESLint for Code Linting

## Decision Description
We have decided to adopt ESLint as our primary tool for linting our JavaScript codebase. ESLint will help us maintain code quality and adhere to coding standards by identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Alternatives Considered
- JSLint: An earlier linting tool for JavaScript with fewer configuration options.
- JSHint: A community-driven tool that detects errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.
- TSLint: A linter specifically for TypeScript, which is not applicable since we are not using TypeScript.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Highly configurable, allowing us to tailor rules to our specific needs. | Initial setup and configuration can be time-consuming. |
| Supports the use of plugins to extend linting capabilities for different frameworks and libraries. | May require developers to learn additional configuration syntax and plugin usage. |
| Integrates with most code editors and IDEs for real-time feedback. | Can slow down the development process if not integrated efficiently into the workflow. |
| Can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines to ensure code quality before merging. | Might be overwhelming with too many rules; requires careful selection of rules to enforce. |
| Encourages consistent coding practices across the team. | Developers may initially resist the introduction of strict linting rules. |
