# Title: Adoption of JSDoc and GitHub Pages for Documentation

## Decision Description
We decided to adopt JSDoc as our documentation generation tool for JavaScript codebase, and to deploy the generated documentation to GitHub Pages. This will allow us to maintain up-to-date and accessible API documentation for our project.

## Alternatives Considered
- Using a wiki or markdown files within the repository for documentation
    - This requires manual updates and is less integrated with the codebase.
- Confluence or other external documentation tools
    - These tools may require additional subscription costs.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Automatically generates documentation from code comments | Requires developers to learn JSDoc syntax |
| Ensures documentation is always synchronized with the code | Initial setup required for JSDoc and GitHub Pages |
| Easy access to documentation via GitHub Pages | GitHub Pages may have limitations for large or complex documentation sites |
| Enhances code readability and maintainability | Relies on developers consistently commenting their code |
| Free and integrated with GitHub |  |

## Notes
The decision to use JSDoc and GitHub Pages was made after considering the ease of maintaining documentation close to the code and the benefits of having an automated process to generate and publish the documentation. We also considered the familiarity of the team with GitHub and the minimal learning curve associated with JSDoc.
